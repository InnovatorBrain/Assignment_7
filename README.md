## What is Markdown?
- Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write plain text using simple syntax.

### Headings
- Headings are created using the '#' symbol, followed by a space and the heading text.
- There are six levels of headings in Markdown, ranging from '#' (h1) to '######' (h6).
- Example: '# This is an h1 heading'

### Lists
- Unordered lists are created using '-' or '+' symbol, followed by a space and the list item text.
- Ordered lists are created using numbers, followed by a period and a space, and the list item text.
- Example:
    - Unordered list item 1
    - Unordered list item 2
    1. Ordered list item 1
    2. Ordered list item 2

### Emphasis
- Emphasis can be added to text using asterisks or underscores.
- One asterisk/underscore for italic, two for bold, three for bold and italic.
- Example: *italic*, **bold**, ***bold and italic***

## Conclusion
